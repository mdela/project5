With Spotify having recently released "Spotify Wrapped 2022", I've also decided to try to make some insights on what and who I've listened to this year.

This program extracts songs from a given playlist on Spotify, adds the songs' information onto a dataframe using pandas, counts the number of songs associated with each artist in that playlist, and graphs it onto a pie chart.

Take for example, my rock playlist. It determined the top 5 artists with the most songs in this playlist. Obviously, going all the way down would show the artist with the least amount of songs:

| Artist                   | Songs in Playlist |
|--------------------------|-------------------|
| The Cure                 | 4                 |
| The All-American Rejects | 4                 |
| Red Hot Chili Peppers    | 3                 |
| Third Eye Blind          | 3                 |
| Bowling For Soup         | 3                 |
| .                        | .                 |
| .                        | .                 |
| .                        | .                 |
| Forever The Sickest Kids | 1                 |


Here is how it looks like on a pie chart. It orders the data from most number of songs associated with that artist to least:
